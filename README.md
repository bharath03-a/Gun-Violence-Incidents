# Gun Violence Incident Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze gun violence incidents in the United States, utilizing a comprehensive dataset containing over 260,000 recorded incidents from January 2013 to March 2018. By leveraging big data technologies like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and machine learning, we seek to uncover insights, predict trends, and facilitate informed decision-making regarding gun violence.
